### Summary

Canine Connection provides a way for dogs owners and appreciators alike to create and share information and interact with one another through a common interest. Dog owners can slide into those Doggy DMâ€™s to discuss fun date ideas between their little furry goofballs. Appreciators can follow their favorite dogs to keep up to date on their  adorable daily puppy patterns. 
<br/><br/>
This application is a social media application specifically geared towards dogs which allows users to form a profile for their dog then like, follow and instant message other dogs and finally post updates on their own profile for other users to appreciate in their user feed. 
<br/>
### Minimum Viable Product 

Our minimum viable product will allow the user to view a picture of a dog, then hit next and have another dog's picture be pulled up. We will build this on top of our existing code for the previous Instagram project found here: [LINK INSTAGRAM REPO HERE]. <br/>
Our minimum viable product will involve 1 View, Model and Controller. 
<br/><br/>
The controller talks to the model to pull up the next name/picture/likes combination upon two actions: Click of the "next" button which simply pulls up the next combo, or the "like" button which adds a like to the current combination, then pulls up the next one. 
<br/> <br/>
The model will contain four attributes: Name of dog, picture of dog, description of dog, number of likes. We will use the paperclip gem to implement this database as it allows us to easily place pictures in our database. 
<br/><br/>
Our view will use the same Bootstrap template as the Instagram project for its layout.

### Summary

Canine Connection provides a way for dogs owners and appreciators alike to create and share information and interact with one another through a common interest. Dog owners can slide into those Doggy DMâ€™s to discuss fun date ideas between their little furry goofballs. Appreciators can follow their favorite dogs to keep up to date on their  adorable daily puppy patterns. 
<br/><br/>
This application is a social media application specifically geared towards dogs which allows users to form a profile for their dog then like, follow and instant message other dogs and finally post updates on their own profile for other users to appreciate in their user feed. 
<br/>
### Minimum Viable Product 

Our minimum viable product will allow the user to view a picture of a dog posted by another user into the database, then hit next and have another dog's picture be pulled up. We will build this on top of our existing code for the previous Instagram project found here: https://github.com/MontanaRoberts/MontanaRoberts-Instagram. <br/>
Our minimum viable product will involve 1 View, Model and Controller. 
<br/><br/>
The controller talks to the model to pull up the next picture (and its description) after one of two actions are taken by the user. Clicking the "next" button will simply pull up the next photo, clicking the "like" button will add a like to the current photo, then pull up the next one. 
<br/> <br/>
The model will contain four attributes: Dog's name, picture, a short description, and number of likes it has received. We will use the paperclip gem to implement this as it allows us to easily place pictures in our database. 
<br/><br/>
Our view will use the same Bootstrap template as the Instagram project for its layout.
